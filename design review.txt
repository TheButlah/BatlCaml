3110 Design Review Notes:

- Goal: OCaml version of RoboCode — provides api for user to write code to control ai of robots in simulation

- Game state in model component of design
	- game, bot, bullet

- Game.ml
	- lots of things to make sure get updated correctly on each step — one mistake could mess up whole simulation

-Bot.ml
	- looks good

- usually use records as data structure to track state of objects/modules

- go over data structures before start programming

- api file:
	- used by coder to write own OCaml file to be used as an api
	- coders would include code and would recompile to run
	- ai takes in a bot and modifies it?
	- opened inside an ai

- add way to control two different bots and:
	- two variables both of type bot i.e.:
	- each bot depends on an ai and that affects their behavior

- takes in two different ai modules and creates bots based on them

- use functors to make bots

- api takes data type in the bot module that represents state
	- game module referencing api?
	- users don’t need to use it

- user should only modify the ai file
	- everything dependent on that

- make sure everyone is on the same page for all of implementation
	- let everyone know when push something to avoid merge conflicts

- make sure decide data structures before implementation

- Main file is helper function to find user code and recompile it into a simulation
	- sort of like a user-friendly make file
	- figure out specifics of this before start implementing

- ai is logic of a bot
	- needs to be part of game because needs access to both bots

- if want more than two bots would need list of bots in the game file
	*- list of modules
	- imperative features
	- arrays
	- association list (bot*ai)

- records for bot state

- experiment with implementations and how to store things
	- list of functions
	- list of modules

- start with set number of bots then move on to try and incorporate multiple bots

- api need to be inside game to get enemy robot info

- don’t need values at the time of execution in api?
	- trickier
	- might use imperative features

- timeline for when each part should be done by to allow time for testing

- write tests for each others parts
